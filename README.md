##Virtual Box and Git Project

This project is aimed at introducing the basics of virtualization and version control using Virtual Box and Git.

**Virtual Box**

Virtual Box is a virtualization software that allows us to run multiple operating systems on one physical machine. It allows us to create virtual machines, configure their network settings, install operating systems, and run them as if they were real physical machines.

**Git**

Git is a distributed version control system. It allows us to track changes in our codebase, collaborate with others, and keep a history of our work. Git is widely used by developers and organizations to manage their source code and collaborate on projects.

Together, Virtual Box and Git are powerful tools for developers and IT professionals.
